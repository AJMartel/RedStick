[*SparkFun RedStick (DEV-13741)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13741)

A 328p micro board with boost regulator that runs at 16MHz and has a built in boost regulator for battery usage.

Spawned from the BadgerStick promo.

The RedStick combines some of our favorite features like
 the Uno's Optiboot bootloader, the FTDI, small size, and the ability to plug directly into a computer's USB port (no FTDI board or USB cable required).
